
Thank you for supporting the project and purchasing the gear print files.


Using this Folder

You can locate the STL file for 3D printing in the CAD directory. Before you begin printing, you'll need to modify the STL file using your preferred slicer software.

The print and parts list file provides a summary of all the gearboxes and specifies the parts that need to be printed. Additionally, it includes a list of all the necessary additional components, such as screws and ball bearings.

If you cannot open the files, you will also find a list of all the additional parts required here.

Tips for printing

You can 3D print the gears using regular PLA. If you encounter assembly issues and the gears do not fit properly, there are two important slicer settings that you may need to adjust.
Horizontal Expansion
Hole Horizontal Expansion
This applies an offset that ensures parts are slightly smaller or larger.
